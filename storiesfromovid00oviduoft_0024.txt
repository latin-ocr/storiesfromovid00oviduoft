4. HINTS ox TRANSLATION.

Three things are essential for arriving at the meaning
of a Latin sentence: one must know the right meaning
of each word3 one must understand the syntactical
construction of each3 and one must seek or avoid -
emphasis, as the Latin directs.

There is only a very limited number of Latin words
which may be translated in all cases by the same
English equivalent. It is much more usual to find
that the dictionary or vocabulary furnishes three or
four various meanings, not to say a dozen or twenty,
for one single Latin word 3 and it very rarely happens
that the dictionary gives all the possible ways of ren·
dei-ing any particular word. Yet it makes a very

the “ lord '' or ‘⁴ master” or ‘⁶ owner” of a house 'or a .
‘horse3 and whether we call him a ‘⁶ man‚” a ⁸· warrior‚''
a “ hero‚'’ or a “husband” And these are but a few
of the possible renderings of the common words dom inus
and τίν. In·fact‚ the sense of the simplest and shortest
sentence may be totally altered by using in the trans-
lation words which, though in themselves quite correct,
are not correct in that particular case. The first thing
to realize is, that· the man who wrote the sentence had
a meaning), and we may be perfectly sure that we have
not found out his meaning until our translation like·
wise possesses a clear and intelligible meaning. It is
of no use to look up word after word as they come, and
set down the first equit-alent which the voeabulary
furnishes. We must read the sentence over once and
again until we have gathered something of its drift.
This will suggest more. and this again something
further, until at length. being quite sure of what was
