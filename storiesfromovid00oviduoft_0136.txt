[Paris was the son of Priam, king] of Troy. At his birth his mother
dreamed that he would be the rain of Troy, and therefore his parente
determined that he should not live. They ordered him to be thrown to
the wild bens-ts on Moune Ida, near to Troy, but he was found by shep-

herds, and yrew up amonyst them as a famous hunter, and he married 1

the nymph Oenone. Nou· when the three qoddesses, Juno and Minerva
ami 1 ⁷enns, were disputiny as to which of them was the sairest, they
chose Paris to decide. Paris ραι-ε the prece of beauty to Venus, hecate-ve
she had promised, tf he would do so, to yire to him the most beautiful
woman in Greece to be his wife. Th is was Helen, queen of Sparta and
wife of Ᾱίέηέἰᾱιιε. Paris left Oenone and sailed to Greeoe, and carried

Helen awa-rs to Troy. To rec-orer Helen, the Greeks made war aqainst ”

Troy, and destroyed the tou-n. So was fulfilled the dream that Paris
should be the rain of his-tidher's ke'nydom. This poem pur-ports to be
a letter written by the deser-tect Oenone to her failhless husband]

2. littera: in prose a “letter” “episile‚'’ is expressed by the
plural litterae, but poetry oecasionally uses the singuliu- in the
same sense. Mycenaea: ,Umbriae (mrum) was the royal city of
Agamemnon, the brother of Mznffius„ and sovereign of all tho
Greeks in Trojan times. Hence ,ἲίμσῦησιίιε (-α, mm) comes to
mean simply ⁸· Grecian. '' Oenone is of course thinking of Helen,
who was a Greek indeed, but a native of Sparta, not of
Mycenae.

7. patiare: subjunctive of the supposed case. and expressed in

the indefinite second person— ‘⁴ whatever a man may suffer-J·
ex merito: “ justly.''

8. indigno: ‘⁴ to one who deser-ves it not.”

10. flumine: Oenone was said to be the daughter of the rive!
Cebren. which rose in Mt. Ida. When she married Paris he wne
only a shepherd, and his parentage was unknown.

11. Priamides: “a son of Prinm.'‘ who was king of Troy.
After Paris had grown up and married Oenone. his true piu-entage
was discovered and he was ncknowledged by his father. abdi
reverentia voro: literalIy, ⁴· let sear be absent from the truth,” m.
‘⁴ let. me tell the truth fearlesaly.‘’
