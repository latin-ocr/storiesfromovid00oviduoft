caesura cannot occur between the separate syllables of
one and the same word..

Thus, the sohemes of the regular hexameter and.
pentameter are as follows :——-

{-—1--1-11-1—-1-w1—-
-ψψιψι-ιιυωι-»ωι-ψυι-υ

By Prosody is meant the rules which determine the
quantities of various syllables. These rules are almost
all liable to exceptions, and there is given here only
such brief outline as may enable the beginner to deter- -
mine the quantity of any syllable as it stands in the text
of these selections. For it is impossible to be sure of
translating Latin poetry correctly without being able to
‚determine the quantity of every syllable in the verse.
It is only by prosody that we ean distinguish between a
very large number of case-forms: αφ, rosa may be nom.
sing. (rosa) or abl. sing. (rossi) ; and bona may be
either nom. sing. fem. (bonci) or nom. and aecus. neut.
plur. (bona) 01· abl. sing. fem. (bona). So saltas is
nom. sing„ but saltas is gen. sing. οι· 110111. and accus.
plural. By prosocly, too, we can distinguish between
words of the same form from different stems. Thus,
ὀνῖε is gen. sing. of ds, but ὂνῑε is dat. and abl. plur. of
ὀνιῖ,· salis is from sc‘z‘lio, but εᾶἷῖε is from sal; from ’νὲρο
we have νὲῃιέ, νέςγῖ, and νόῃέ, but from rex we have
τὲςίε, νέςῖ, ancl req& mdnes is a noun, but mdnes is 8,
verb.
