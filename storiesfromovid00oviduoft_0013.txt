and Tibullus and Horace amongst others. For a little
while it seemed as if he would occupy himself with
public life and politics‚ but after serving in the capa-
cities of Centumvir and Triumvir‚¹ judicial offices of
minor importance, his natural indolence got the better
of him: he declined to seek any further office, aban-
doned his opportunity of becoming a senator, and
retired into private life as a simple knight. As he
phrases it, he “ cut down the stripe upon his gown, for
the broader stripe (of the senator’s gown) was too
much of a burden.’'² Henceforth he was content with
the narrow stripe and gold ring of knighthood.

It was about the year 20 B.C. that Ovid returned
from his travels and settled permanently in Rome.
He had probably already been divorced from his first
wife, and was now married to a second, with whom he
lived unhappily for some time. He was a man of little
principle, and he neglected his wife while he paid too
much attention to another lady whom he calls Corinna.³
Who she really was is not known: it is commonly said
that she was the princess Julia, the daughter of the
Emperor Augustus, and sometime the wife of Tiberius,
who succeeded to Augustus. That Corinna was a lady
of high rank and reckless life is certain, and J ulia was
both high-born and profligate. Whoever she may
have been, it was to Corinna that the poet addressed
his first publications, a collection of love-poems called
Amores-‚⁴ “ Loves.'‘ A few of them are beautiful, many
of them not worth reading, and some not fit to read3
and they are chiefly notable as proving that Ovid was
a profligate.. His next work was a volume styled
Heroides,⁵ “ Heroines‚'' containing imaginary letters
