in the writer's mind, we can safely put it into the
proper words in English.

But it is hopeless to think of arriving at what was
in the writer’s mind until we have analysed the syntax
of the sentence, be it short or long. It is useless to
“ jump ’' at the translation because we chance to know
one or two of the words before us. The parts of the
sentence must be taken in as rigorous an order as those
of an English sentence set for analysiS. Subject and
extension of the subject, predicate and extension of
the predicate, object nearer or more remote, adverbs
and adverbial clauses—these have the same value in
Latin as in English, and are quite as easy to master.
To understand the syntax is to know what one has to
build; properly to select one’s words is to use the
proper materials for the building.

Emphasis is marked in Latin ahnost entirely by
the position of the word in the sentence. The em-
phatic word will usually stand first, sometimes last,
in the sentence. In written English we cannot always
use the same simple means of pointing emphasis, and
as a rule we require to mark it by greater or less
periphrasis. Thus, to translate correctly the sentences
(l) Caesar hoc fecit, (2) Hoc Caesar-fecit, and (3) Ηοο
fecit Caesar, we might have to say (1) “Caesar did it,’'
(2) ‘⁶ It was this that Caesar did,” and (3) “ This it was
that Caesar didff'

When we understand the syntax and have chosen
the appropriate words, and have given to each its
proper emphasis, we shall usually have arrived at an
z’ntelliyz'ble translation, but not necessarily at an z'dz'o-
matio translation. English commonly avoids long and
complex sentences, while Latin affects them3 and to
make readable English of our translation it may be
