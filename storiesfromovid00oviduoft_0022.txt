(iv.) Syllables ending in a consonant other than
c, s, m are short.

(v.) Syllables ending in c are long (e.9.‚ illico).

(vi.) as, es, os are long.

But es is short in such noms. sing. as pedes (gen.
peditis), and in Greek noms. plur. (e.9., Cyclades).
In similar Greek noms. sing. and accus. plur„ as ’
13 short (0.9, lampds, Erytheidds). So os in Greek
11011113 singular (0.9, αοΖι”ηό3,Ῑ Erymanthidb‘s).

(vii.) is is long in dat. and abl. plur. (0.9, bonis,
rosis), in accus. plur. (0.9, navis = ‘naz-es), and in 2nd

declension as salios, in nom., voc„ and accus. plur. (e.9.‚

(ix.) Syllables ending in m disappear in scansion if
preceding an inibial vowel or h in the word next
following, and the same applies to any final vowel in
the like position. Thus, monstrum horrendum informe
z'nyens is, for purposes of scansion, pronounced vnz‹⁷2„‹›·t1·'
horrend' inform’ inqens.

Applying the foregoing rules, we have the following
as examples of scansion :—
