of his descent, and inclined to be boastful about it3 for,
while almost every one with a certain amount of property
could claim the same rank, and wear the knight’s gold
ring and uniform, and enjoy the knight's privilege of a
front seat in the theatre, yet society in Rome made a
very decided distinction between the mere parrenu or
nouveau riche and the man who could assert “the olaims
of long descent.''

In the Rome of that date there was practically only
one fashion of education: every young Roman who
could afford it was trained for the bar. Accordingly,
both Ovid and his brother were taken to Rome and
put under the care of the most reputable tutors of the
day.¹ The elder boy worked hard, but he died before
he had well reached manhood: the younger boy, the
poet, disliked work, and could scarcely be persuaded to
keep up his studies at all. He must have been a
greedy reader, but the books which he most liked were
not those which would fit him to be a successful
advocate: they, were books of poetry‚ legends, and
mythology, and the boy would scribble verses when he
should have been writing essays. It was useless for
his father and his friends to point out that authorship
was but a sorry means of livelihood.² The young poet
could not write prose even if he tried, and, when his
brother's death left him heir to all the family property,
he was allowed to have his own way. He gave up his
studies in Rome, and went to Athens to study Greek
literature. From Athens he went on to Asia Minor,
and after another twelve months' stay in Sicily he
returned to Rome, where he made acquaintance with
most of the great poets of the time³——with Propertius
