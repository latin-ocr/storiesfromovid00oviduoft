and independent '; so that one never meets in Ovid those
involved sentences, of perhaps a dozen lines in length,
which make so difficult for beginners the lang-uage of
many other Latin authors.

2. ΟΝ METRE.

In Latin poetry each line constitutes a verse.
Each verse is made up of a certain number of feet, and
each foot contains a certain number of syllables. The
poetry of Ovid is written who'lly in verse of two kinds
only ε either it is entirely in hexameters (αφ, the
Metamorphoses), or it is in alternate hexameters and
pentameters (e.9., the Amores, Fasti, Tristia). In the
latter case it is known as Elegiae verse.¹

There are in hexameters and pentameters only three
varieties of feet: (i.) the Dactyh or one long syllable
followed by two short (⁹⁹) ; (ii.) the Spondeo, 01· two
long syllables (“ “) ; (111.) the Trochee, or one long
syllable followed by one short (“ ⁸³). A hexameter
verse contains six feet 3 a pentameter contains four
whole feet and two half-feet, or five feet in all. For
example, take the following hexameters' :--

1 2 3 4 5 6

Dic, fige, Ι frigori· Ι bus ΙΙ (11ιῆ- Ι re novus Ι incipit Ι finnus,

Pin-pure- Ι fis Aur· Ι ora ΙΙ for· Ι es et Ι ΡΙὸῃῑί ros· Ι furum,

Incurs- Ι {int stell· Ι is ΙΙ Γῖιρῑ- Ι sintque pt‘Sr Ι fivia} Ι osu-ruffi

¹ So called because in this metre were written most ele-yies,

mom-usu] poema expressing sorrow. Ovid puns upon the mune in
46, 3.

² Tho rh yth m of the verso may roudily be caught by remembering
that there is an nocent in ench foot or half-foot, and that it falls
upon the first syllable in euch. Tho following couplet of Tenny-
son'n may help to tho sunu* end :--—
⁸· Thone lame Hfixanwtfirs the strong-wing'd munio of Homer!
No-bnt a most. but-lemno barbanum ‹3xperim6nt. ’'
The whole of Longfellow's Evanyeliue is written in hexameters.
