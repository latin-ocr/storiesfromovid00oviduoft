In fact, the quantity of only a very few syllables (e.q.‚ diph-
thongs and contr-acted syllables) is to be certainly determined by
the rules given above. In the great majority of cases it is variable.
By applying the rules above given we can, however, determine the
quantity of most final syllables, and the quantity of most vowels
which precede two or more consonants.

There remains a very large number of syllables which do not
fall under any of the rules given above, viz., such syllables ae,
not being final or contracted syllables, consist of—

(a) a single vowel followed by a single consonant;

(b) a single vowel followed by a mute (h, c, d, 9, p, t) and a
liquid (l, r) ;

(c) a single vowel followed by another consonant and Ιι.

The quantity of such syllables is not determlned by rule: it is
arbitram-y, and such are said to be long or short “ by authority.”
Examples are the marked syllables in deicis (fr. dux), dacis (fr.
daem dico and ιίἶοο ,· ›26Ien3 and Δι·ὄίε,ἠ3,,· macer and pdter,· cicer
“ keen'ffi cicer (“ maple ’')‚ and ἄρον. These we may term
radical quantities‚ and these are marked in the Vocabulary.

Arbitrary also are the quantities of inflexione, as ducebat, ducet-e,
dicare, dic-aibat, matribus, αρνᾶνιιηι, διο. The quantities of such
syllables we learn from grammar or the vocabulary‚ or both.

Inflexional quantities are invariable.¹

So also are radical quantities‚ unless affected by the rules (A. iii„
iv.) qiven above. But those rules can affect a radical syllable in
one way only ε if the radical syllable be short (αφ, in dqer, pater),
it may become long (effi, ,mitris as well as patris, dqros as well as
dqros, according to rule A. iv.); but, if the radical syllable be
long, it can under no circumstances become short (αφ, from mdter
we cannot have such a form as ηιᾶινί.·ι).2

¹Exceptions occur, indeed, but they are too few to detain us
here. The most noticeable is the shortening of forms like steterunt
to sectarunt.

⁹ The student will remember that the same word may have more
than one stem, and therefore more than one radical quantity;
ea„ the verb suqio has present-stem fz‘iq-‚ perfect-stemerq-‚ but
3131 quantity of this syllable in all forms derived from each stem

“ be invariable.
