INTRODUCTION. 17

A. Of syllables Generally.— The following rules
apply to all syllables :—

(i.) A diphthong or a contracted syllable is long3
e.9.‚ bonffi, complbrit (τ- compleverit), ηῑί (Ξ ηἴῘῑῖΖ).

(11.) When two vowels come together in one and the
same word without forming a diphthong‚ the former of
the two will be short: e.q.,face⁹o‚ mis. But there are
exceptions, such as the inflections of ᾱὲν (89, cieris,
ᾱένετ, ἄτα), Εόῑιε, &cxl

(iii.) When a vowel is followed by two consonants
(other than h), it will be long (e.q.‚ alzZmnus, zmardydus‚²
iinhelans) 3 but

(iv.) If the first of such two consonants be a mute
(b, c, d, 9, p, t), and the second be l or r, the preceding
vowel, unless long by authority (see below), may be
either long or short: ρ.9., Ρᾶΐνίε from pater, but mdtrz‘s
from mdter.

Rules (iii.) and (iv.) apply to final syllables as well
as to others. Thus we may have hauserat Auster, but
hausercit pocula ; θωαηιίηῖε ulmo, but omnis viri.

B. 0f Final Syllables.-The following rules apply to
final syllables :—
(i.) The vowels α, ι’, ο, u are long.

But a is short in nom., voc.‚ and accus: e.9.‚
‘men-sd, bonci, aetherd, Miletida. In mihi and tib'i, i
is long 01· short. In the name N as5, o is always short.

(ii.) e is short, except in the lst and 5th declensions
(e.9.‚ Cybelei, die), in Qud sing. imper. act. of 2nd conju-
gation (0.9, mane), and. in most adverbs (e.9.‚ pavide).

(111.) 9 is short (e 9., Τείῆᾔ, Capy).

¹ This does not apply to consonantal t (j), which is pronounced
as 9 and treated as a consonant; ε.9., 111 iam, iac-2 o, iniecit (pro-

nouncedr ,ται n, yn cio inye ecit).
² An exception occurs in 22‚1,hebeear52.maraqdos
