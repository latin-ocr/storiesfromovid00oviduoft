Anomvr.—-Time can tame the fier-cest animale. Time brinqs
the small seed to fruition, and wear-s away the har-dest stoue. Only to
me it brings no cure of my sorrow& My misery is ever with me, and,
the Ionqer it qrows, the more keenly do I feel it, nor have I now tlte
couroye that once Ι had. I am pinivy for lack of all Ι love, and
death will speedily brinq me peace.

ninq of 11 An]

1. tempore: “ by lapse of time.” aratri : the present participle
used as an adjective requires a genitive of the object. Thus
vir patiens laborem = “ a man who is sufferinq toil,’' but vir patiens
laboris = “ a man able to suffer toi1.”

4. lupos: the most painful kind of “ bit ’' for horses was called
lupus, because it was set with barbs like wolves’ teech.

5. Poenorum: (Poenus, -a, -um) means “ Carthaginian.’' Carth-
age was on the Bay of Tunis, in Northern Africa, so that Poena-¹l
comes to be used generally for ‘⁴ Afiican.'’

6. animo: either ablativo (local) or dative.
7. inda: the “ Indian brute ’' is the elephant.
10. capiant: ‘⁴ contain‚’' “ find room for.’'

predicate.

the soil new ’' by breaking iz· up for a new crop.

14. adamanta: Greek accusative singular of adamas.

19. ut...careoz “ since I have been away from.” This is a
rather rare meaning of ut.

20. podo: the grapes are put into vats (lacus, 39, 20), and the
jm'ce pressed out of them by treading.

22. sensum: ‘⁴ has the smart of a grief that is fresh.'‘ His
grief is just as keen after two years as it was when new.

43.

4. ut: concessive (“ though ''). Hence the mood of eit.
