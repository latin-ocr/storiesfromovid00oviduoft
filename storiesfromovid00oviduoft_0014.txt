contrive to write some one—and-twenty of such letters,

these poems to-day, they were popular enough in Rome,
and made Ovid’s name famous at once. He came to
think himself the inspired bard of love, and to believe
himself entitled to write whatever he pleased. Under
this impression he published, about 2 13.c., his third
