NOTES. 133

12. nubere: the word originally meant “to take the marriage-
veil '’ for 8 man, ‘⁴ to marry ’² him. Hence nubere is only used in
speaking· of a woman’s marriage, and servo is the dative. When a

man married he was said ducere uxorem, “to lead home a wife.”
tuli: “Ideigned„”

15. iacentibus: sc. nobis, dative of the agent.

17. quis : the answer is, of course, ‘⁴ Oenone.''

18. tegeret: subjunctive of indirect question depending on qua.
19. maculis: the ·‘ meshes ” of the hunter’s nets.

21. a te : to be joined with incisae. Paris had cut Oenone's name
upon the bark of trees, as lovers will. As the trees grew, the letters
carved upon them grew also.

24, in titulos: “ grow 011, and rise aright to form my epitaph Σ ”
Ξῖἰῐξξέε them grow until they resemble the epitaph carved upon

28. Xanthi: one of the rivers of Troy. As rivers cannot fiow
backwards, the meaning is that Paris would nez-er be able to live
without Oenone. '

53.

4. venit : alluding to the occasion of the “ J udgment of Paris,’'

when Paris decided which for the three goddesses was the most
beautiful. See the Introduction to the Notes on 52.

8. nefas : it was a sin for Paris to think of carrying off Helen.

9. caesa abies: ‘⁴ pine trees were felled '’ to build the ships with
which Paris was to sail to Greece.

10. ceratas: “caulked.''
11. flesti: flet-isti. So iu line 13.

H112. iste: “that love which you now fee1,” i.c. the 1018 of
een.

13. flentis: nostros stands, as often in poetry. for meos, Meos
flentis would be an ordinary kind of syntax, flentis agreeing with
the genitive of the persona! pronoun (mei) understood from the
possessive meos. So we should have nostrosflmtitzrtt. But as nos-
tros here has the sense of meos it has also the same syntax.

15. vitibus ulmos: ep⁴ 45, 9, note.

17. vento teneri: “ wind-boundss' prevented from sailing by
conta-ary winde.

18. me: sc. ventus. Paris thought the wind adverse, but
Oenone and others thought it favoni-able, because it hindered him
hom salling upon his fatal mand.
