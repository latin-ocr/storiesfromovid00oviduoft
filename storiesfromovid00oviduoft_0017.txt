INTRODUCTION. 13

her; but Augustus must ¹have found them out long
before, if Corinna were really his own daughter. In
another passage Ovid tells us that his ‘⁵ blunder’' lay
in having unintentionally seen something which he
ought not to have seen. It must have been something
exceedingly grave, to call for so heavy a punishment.
J ulia was banished in the same year as was Ovid, and,
almost certainly, Ovid’s exile was connected with that
of Julia, but probably not because of a love-affair.
Some think that Julia was involved in a plot against
the Emperor, her father, and that Ovid had, by some
means, become aware of it. But we do not know, and,
most probably, we never shall know. All that is cer-
tain is that Ovid was banished for some unascertainable
offence, and that the Emperor, not wishing to state
publicly what that offence was, found an excuse for his
severity in those evil poems which Ovid had published
fully ten years before.

Ovid was not one of the greatest of Latin poets,
although he was the most voluminous. He is too arti-
ficial and affected, too consciously determined to be
elever, and too wordy. His poetry never comes from
the heart, and is never really simple, as the best and
truest poetry must be. When he writes love poetry he
cannot equal Tibullus; when he writes hexameters he
is far behind Virgil. But no poet was ever so inge·
mous, so varied, so harmonious a writer of elegiacs as
was he3 and he has always been the model for those
who would learn how to write elegiae verse. And though
his thoughts are artificial, his language is simple. It
is very seldom, indeed, that his meaning cannot be
discovered by the simplest rules of syntax. Moreover,
the laws of elegiac verse require that every two lines,
each couplet that is, should be complete in themselves
