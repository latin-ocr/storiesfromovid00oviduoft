And the sad soi-tows that on mortale wait
Can ever move celestial hearts with pain—

“ Come, doleful Elegy ἴ too just a name !
Unbind thy tresses fair, in loose attire,

For he, thy bard, the herald of thy fame,
Tibullus, burns on the funerea] pyre.

“ Ah, lifeless corse 3 Lo, Venus’ boy draws near
With upturned quiver and with shattered bow ;
His torch extinguished, see him toward the bier
With drooping w’ings disoonsolately go.

“ He smites his heaving breast with crue] blow ;
Those straggling looks, his neck all streaming round,
-Receive the tears that fastly trickling flow,
While sobs convulsive from his lips resound. '‘ ¹

The original of the foregoing· is to be found in the
first twelve lines of the Selection numbered 46. The
following is to be found in Selection 61 :—

“ The high-souled maid
Such insult not endured, and round her neck
Indignant twined the suicidal noose,
And so had died. But, as she hung, some ruth
Stirred in Minerva’s breast ; the pendent form
She raised, and ‘ Lire 1 ‘ she said ; ‘ but hang thou still
For ever, wretch! And through all future time,
Even to thy latest race bequeath thy doom! ’

Nose and ear

Were lost ε her form to smallest bulk compi-essed,

A head minutest crowned : to slenderest legs

J ointed on either side her fingere changed ;

Her body but a bag, whence still she draws

Her filmy threads‚ and, with her ancient art,

Weaves the fine meshes of her Spider‘s web.'' ²
