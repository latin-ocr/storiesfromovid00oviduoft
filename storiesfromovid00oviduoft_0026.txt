22 INTRODUCTION.

necessary to split up our result into shorter sentences,
to arrange them in a different order, to turn active
verbs into passives, subjects into objects‚ adjectives
into adverbs, and so on. But two things must be borne
in mind: firstly, it is impossible thus correctly to make

good English of one's translation until one has fust ,

worked it out in the proper way3 and, secondly, if it
has first been so worked out and understood, it is the
simplest thing in the world to turn it into good English
—such English, that is, as we should ouiselves employ
in expressing the same thoughts.

Ovid's language is so simple that there can seldom
be any difficulty in analysing his syntax and relegating
each clause to its proper place in the sentence. This
is chiefly because the rules of elegiae verse do not
allow the sense to run on beyond the end of the second

(pentameter) line; the longest sentence, with rare ⁷

exceptions, may not exceed the space of a single elegiae
couplet. On the other hand, for the same reason, the
sentences, when turned into English, frequently seem
to follow one another in a rather inconsequent fashion.
But this is only a seeming result. A very little care
will show what is the real sequence of thought, and
will enable us to add such conjunctions or phrases as
are needful to connect 0116 couplet with another and >
produce a connected whole.

Ovid was a poet, and we cannot all at first produce
poetical translations 3 but practice and effort will
speedily remove much of our difficulty. To show what
may be done in the way of turning his Latin into
English that is at once good. correct, and poetical, we
quote the two exmnples sub-joined :—
