Note the following special rules :—

(a) The fifth foot ot a hexameter must be a dactyl.
Very occasionally a spondee takes its place.

(b) The sixth foot of ahexameter cannot be a daetyl.

(c) A trochee can stand only in the sixth foot of a
hexameter.

(d) The first half-foot of a pentameter must be a
long syllable.

(e) The third and fourth feet of a pentameter must
be dactyls.

(f) The second half-foot of a pentameter may be
either long or short, and must belong to a word of two
syllables only.

With these reservatione, any foot of either hexameter
or pentameter may be either a spondee or a daotyl.

In both hexameter and pentameter there must be a
pause in or near the middle of the verse. This pause
is known as the Caes-nra (“ cutting ''). In the penta-
meter it invariably comes after the first half-foot.
In the hexameter its proper place is after the first
syllable of the third foot (strong caesura), but it
frequently comes after the second syllable of that foot
when the foot is a dactyl (weak caesura), and very
occasionally it occurs in the corresponding places in
the fourth foot. In the examples given, it is marked
by the double lines (ΙΙ).

This pause is not necessarily eoincident with a sign
of punctuation. It is no more than the needful break
ocem-ring in pronouncing two separate words. The
